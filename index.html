        <h3>What is multiplication?</h3>
        <p>

            In the universe of mathematics there are four basic operations called subtraction, addition, multiplication
            and division.
            <br>
            Multiplication is generally known by the symbols of (cross x, by the dot operator., And in computing by the
            asterisk *).
            <br>
            <br>
            Multiplication is nothing more than a number adding up itself, until you reach the result that is known as a
            product, this type of operation is a more accessible way to add the numbers, where the order of the factors
            does not change the product, factors are the numbers that are involved in the operation, known as
            multiplying and the multiplier, that is, if we have 2x5 = 10 or 5x2 = 10 the product that is the result
            (which in our case is 10) of that multiplication is the same ten.
            Another effective way of multiplication is to do it by rows and columns, that is, instead of counting all
            the objects present to arrive at the result, we can only count how many objects there are in the line, which
            for example can be 8, and then we count how many objects there are in the column that for example could be
            10. Bearing this in mind that our row has 8 objects and our column has 10, so our calculation looks like
            this:
            <br>
            <br>
            8 X 10
            <br>
            <br>
            This calculation is the same as saying that I want to add the 10, 8 times by itself. So our calculation
            looks like this:
            <br>
            <br>
            10 + 10 +10 +10 +10 +10 +10 + 10 = 80
            <br>
            <br>
            So the result of our multiplication of 8 X 10 = 80.
            <br>
            <br>
            So we managed to simplify the counting of our objects, because instead of counting everything one by one, we
            count the rows and columns and add up.
        </p>
        <h3>Hystory</h3>
        <p>

            The oldest known multiplication tables were used by the Babylonians about 4000 years ago. However, they used
            a base of 60. The oldest known tables using a base of 10 are the Chinese decimal multiplication table on
            bamboo strips dating to about 305 BC, during China's Warring States period.
            <br>
            <br>
            "Table of Pythagoras" on Napier's bones
            The multiplication table is sometimes attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras (570–495 BC).
            It is also called the Table of Pythagoras in many languages (for example French, Italian and Russian),
            sometimes in English. The Greco-Roman mathematician Nichomachus (60–120 AD), a follower of
            Neopythagoreanism, included a multiplication table in his Introduction to Arithmetic, whereas the oldest
            surviving Greek multiplication table is on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD and currently housed in
            the British Museum.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 493 AD, Victorius of Aquitaine wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the
            product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were "a list of numbers starting with one thousand,
            descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the
            fractions down to 1/144."
            <br>
            <br>
            In his 1820 book The Philosophy of Arithmetic, mathematician John Leslie published a multiplication table up
            to 99 × 99, which allows numbers to be multiplied in pairs of digits at a time. Leslie also recommended that
            young pupils memorize the multiplication table up to 50 × 50. The illustration below shows a table up to 12
            × 12, which is a size commonly used in schools.

        </p>
        <h3>Standards-based mathematics reform in the US</h3>

        <p>
            In 1989, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) developed new standards which were based on
            the belief that all students should learn higher-order thinking skills, which recommended reduced emphasis
            on the teaching of traditional methods that relied on rote memorization, such as multiplication tables.
            Widely adopted texts such as Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space (widely known as TERC after its
            producer, Technical Education Research Centers) omitted aids such as multiplication tables in early
            editions. NCTM made it clear in their 2006 Focal Points that basic mathematics facts must be learned, though
            there is no consensus on whether rote memorization is the best method.
        </p>

        <h3>Chinese multiplication table</h3>

        <p>
            The Chinese multiplication table consists of eighty-one sentences with four or five Chinese characters per
            sentence, making it easy for children to learn by heart. A shorter version of the table consists of only
            forty-five sentences, as terms such as "nine eights beget seventy-two" are identical to "eight nines beget
            seventy-two" so there is no need to learn them twice.
            <br>
            <br>
            A minimum version by removing all "one" sentences,
            consists of only thirty-six sentences, which is most commonly used in schools in China. It's often in this
            order: 2x2=4, 2x3=6, ..., 2x8=16, 2x9=18, 3x3, 3x4, ..., 3x9, 4x4, ..., 4x9, 5x5,...,9x9
        </p>
